LuaWrapper
==========

This easy to use wrapper brings Lua scripts closer to C++, these are the main features:

- You can expose C++ static/non static functions.
- You can expose C++ class and methods as Lua table
- Smart Pointers are supported, so you don't need to manual release you wrapper objects.

In order to use this wrapper you will need to enable C++11 flag in your compiler.
Current version requires Lua 5.2, a branch for Lua 5.1 is available too (an internal version of bit32 is provided 
in this case)
This wrapper is released under MIT License.
